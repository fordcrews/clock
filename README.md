## 🔧 About Me

I'm a career-long systems engineer and cybersecurity specialist with over 25 years of experience designing, securing, and maintaining large-scale computing environments for government and private-sector organizations. My expertise spans hardware, software, networking, and system architecture — with a specialty in building things that *just work* under pressure.

Whether it's locking down 3,000+ endpoints, keeping mission-critical systems secure 24/7, or engineering infrastructure to survive the unexpected, I've built my career on making complex systems clear, resilient, and reliable.

## 💬 Philosophy

> “Good systems are invisible. Great ones survive failures.”  
I believe in designing for chaos, defending from assumptions, and leaving everything more maintainable than I found it. Technology should empower — not just impress.
